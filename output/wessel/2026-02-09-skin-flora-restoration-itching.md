# Skin Flora Restoration: What People Are Saying About Itching & the Itch-Scratch Cycle

## TL;DR

People across Reddit, forums, and review sites are finding relief from chronic itching and scratching through skin microbiome restoration. The dominant approaches fall into five buckets: **topical probiotics** (Gladskin, Skinesa/Defensin, Mother Dirt), **bacteriotherapy** (clinical S. hominis A9 treatment), **barrier-first strategies** (ceramides, soak-and-seal), **subtraction methods** (ditching soap, simplifying routines), and **gut-skin axis approaches** (oral probiotics, fermented foods like kefir). The science now confirms that S. aureus directly triggers itch via protease V8 activating nerve receptors — meaning microbiome restoration isn't just about skin appearance, it's about shutting off the itch signal at its source.

## 1. The Science: Why Damaged Skin Flora = Constant Itching

### S. aureus Is Literally Hijacking Your Nerves

A landmark study (published in *Cell*, covered by [Popular Science](https://www.popsci.com/health/why-itch/) and [Science/AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/common-skin-microbe-causes-itchiness-even-without-inflammation)) found:

- **Staphylococcus aureus** releases an enzyme called **protease V8**
- V8 activates the **PAR1 protein** on nerve fibers in the skin
- This sends an itch signal directly to the brain — **no inflammation required**
- In mice, exposure caused intensifying itch over days, with scratching spreading damage to new sites
- The bacteria also triggered **alloknesis** — where normally harmless touch feels unbearably itchy

**Why it matters for sufferers:** ~80% of eczema patients are colonized by S. aureus vs ~10% of the general population. The bacterium may be hijacking the itch-scratch cycle to spread itself to new body sites and new hosts.

**Potential breakthrough:** Existing anti-clotting medications that block PAR1 successfully interrupted the itch-scratch cycle in mice. Researchers say this could lead to new oral meds or creams targeting microbiome-linked itch.

### The Itch-Scratch Cycle, Explained

| Stage | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 1. Dysbiosis | S. aureus overgrows, beneficial bacteria (S. epidermidis, Roseomonas) decline |
| 2. Nerve activation | V8 protease activates PAR1 on sensory neurons |
| 3. Scratching | Damages skin barrier, releases inflammatory mediators |
| 4. More colonization | Broken barrier lets more S. aureus in |
| 5. Repeat | Cycle intensifies; damage spreads to new sites |

## 2. What People Are Actually Trying (Community + Clinical Evidence)

### A. Topical Probiotic Products

#### Gladskin (Micreobalance technology)
- **What it does:** Targets S. aureus specifically while leaving beneficial bacteria intact
- **User reports:** A parent reported it "instantly calmed irritation and redness and stopped the scratching" in a 3-year-old. Reviewer Gemma Evans became a long-term user after nearly a year.
- **Product claim:** 4 out of 5 users report significantly reduced itch and redness
- **Caveat:** Some users say they still need petroleum jelly alongside it

#### Skinesa Defensin+ Probiotic Spray (Roseomonas mucosa)
- **Clinical backing:** Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 trials — most patients saw >75% improvement in eczema severity across all treated sites (elbows, knees, hands, trunk, neck)
- **User reviews:**
  - *"I used this spray for 3 months and it's been 6 weeks since I finished the course and I am still flare free!! My skin has finally healed!"*
  - *"A marked improvement within a week"*
  - *"The histamine itchiness around my waist has gone"*
  - *"Less skin irritation, the itching was slowly going away and my skin was clearing up"* (after 3 months)

#### Mother Dirt AO+ Mist (AOBiome ammonia-oxidizing bacteria)
- **Mechanism:** Sprays live ammonia-oxidizing bacteria onto skin; nitrite/nitric oxide production has anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects
- **User reports:**
  - Hand eczema flare-ups "decreased markedly" after 2 weeks of spray + cleanser
  - Skin looked "plumper," underarms less smelly
  - One reviewer: "significant improvement in overall skin health," less redness and irritation

### B. Bacteriotherapy (Clinical-Grade)

#### UC San Diego Trial — S. hominis A9
- **What they did:** Screened 8,000+ bacterial isolates from healthy skin, identified S. hominis A9 as a potent S. aureus killer. Mixed it into unscented lotion.
- **Results in 54 patients:**
  - **67% reported improved symptoms** (reduced itchiness + inflammation)
  - **67% showed large reductions in S. aureus** on their skin
  - No adverse events
- **Mouse model:** Mice with eczema were "essentially cured"
- **Microbiome transplant subset:** 5 patients received full microbiome transplant — **>90% reduction in staph** on their skin

#### NIH Trial — Roseomonas mucosa (topical)
- Children with moderate eczema saw significant reductions in itching, steroid use, and flare frequency over 16 weeks

### C. Subtraction Methods (Stop Destroying Your Flora)

#### Water-Only / No-Soap Showers
- **Notable case:** One person in Sweden switched to water-only showers after severe dryness and itching from twice-daily washing. After ~1 year: *"My skin healed and returned to its former smooth state and the itchiness stopped."*
- **Protocol:** Lukewarm water, quick rinse, body scrub 1-2x/week, no soap
- **Science:** UCLA research confirms too-frequent bathing disrupts the skin microbiome. Sulfates in soap strip beneficial bacteria. When left alone, the microbiome tends to rebalance itself.

#### Dr. James Hamblin's 5-Year Experiment
- Yale physician gave up soap, shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer entirely for 5 years
- Reported skin stabilized and self-regulated over time

### D. Gut-Skin Axis Approaches

#### Oral Probiotics
- **MyEczemaTeam member reports:**
  - *"Since taking the probiotics, I no longer itch during the day, and I don't scratch when I'm sleeping."*
  - *"I have been taking probiotics for a month now. I have noticed that I am not itching, and I no longer have eczema on the back of my legs. My back is almost clear."*
  - One member rotates probiotic brands to increase bacterial variety

#### Kefir (Fermented Goat's Milk)
- **Gemma Evans' story:** 3 years of perioral dermatitis (dry, scaly, burning rash around mouth). Multiple dermatologists, antibiotics, retinoids, immunosuppressants — all temporary relief only.
- **Protocol:** One glass of Chuckling Goat kefir on empty stomach each morning
- **Timeline:**
  - Week 11: noticeable improvement
  - Week 14: rash completely disappeared
  - Week 18: temporary relapse, increased intake
  - 24 weeks: significant improvement
  - 14 months: skin remained clear, no recurrence
- **Caveat:** Unscientific n=1 experiment; also adopted low-sugar diet

#### Clinical Evidence
- Infants given L. rhamnosus + B. animalis daily for 6 months were **less than half as likely** to develop eczema
- Children whose mothers took Lactobacilli during pregnancy had lower eczema rates ages 2-7
- Meta-analysis: probiotics effective in treating adult AD, measured by SCORAD decrease

## 3. Key Patterns Across All Sources

1. **The microbiome IS the itch.** S. aureus protease V8 directly activates itch neurons. Restoring bacterial balance doesn't just improve skin appearance — it turns off the itch signal itself.

2. **Subtraction before addition.** Many people found relief by *stopping* things (harsh soaps, over-washing, fragranced products) before adding probiotics or treatments.

3. **Timelines vary wildly.** Topical probiotics: days to weeks. Oral probiotics: ~1 month. Kefir/gut approaches: 11-24 weeks. Bacteriotherapy: days. Water-only: months.

4. **Combination approaches win.** The most dramatic reports combine barrier repair + microbiome support + itch management (e.g., moisturize + probiotic + stop scratching).

5. **Individual variation is huge.** Some people swear by tallow, others by kefir, others by prescription biologics. Probiotics can occasionally make things worse in certain individuals.

## 4. Emerging Research to Watch

| Area | Status | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **PAR1 blockers** (anti-clotting drugs repurposed) | Mouse studies successful | Could be the first drug that targets bacteria-driven itch directly |
| **S. hominis A9 lotion** | Phase I complete at UCSD | 67% response, no side effects, could replace steroids |
| **Roseomonas mucosa spray** | Phase 2 data available (Skinesa/Defensin) | >75% improvement, sustained after stopping |
| **Skin microbiome transplants** | 5 patients tested | >90% S. aureus reduction |
| **Rosemary extract** | Lab studies | Disrupts S. aureus virulence mechanisms (itch, scaling, redness) |
| **Probiotic-loaded microspheres** | In vitro 2025 | Controlled release of Lactobacillus plantarum for sustained barrier repair |
