# Your Ovaries Age Faster Than the Rest of You — and 5 Genes Decide When They Quit

Nobody tells you this, but your ovaries are the fastest-aging organ in your body. Not your skin. Not your knees. Your ovaries. They're running on a clock that ticks harder and faster than anything else you've got. And a [Nature study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07931-x) just cracked open the genetics behind why.

Researchers at Exeter, Cambridge, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute analyzed rare genetic variants in 106,973 women from UK Biobank. What they found: **five new genes that affect when you hit menopause.** The biggest one, ZNF518A (found in about 1 in 4,000 women), shifts menopause timing by 5.61 years. That's not a subtle nudge. That's the difference between menopause at 45 and menopause at 51.

The other four are ETAA1, PNPLA8, PALB2, and SAMHD1. Together with four previously known genes (including BRCA2), these rare variants have effects roughly five times larger than any common genetic variant previously linked to menopause. The biggest common variant? Shifts timing by about one year. These shift it by two to five and a half.

## The DNA repair connection

The study identified nine genes total linked to menopause timing. Seven of them are involved in **DNA damage repair**, the same molecular machinery that protects you from cancer. When unrepaired DNA damage builds up in your eggs, those eggs die. Lose enough eggs, and that's menopause. The genes controlling that process are the same ones keeping your cells from going rogue elsewhere.

The cancer connection is direct. BRCA1 carriers hit menopause about 2.1 years earlier. BRCA2 carriers, 1.18 years earlier. And SAMHD1 goes the other direction: its variants delay menopause by about 1.35 years but increase cancer risk in both women and men. Same biological machinery, pulling double duty.

File this under: things that should be common knowledge but somehow aren't.

## What gets passed down

One more thing. Using data from 8,089 family trios in the 100,000 Genomes Project, the researchers found that mothers who carry more early-menopause genetic variants pass more de novo mutations to their children. De novo mutations are brand-new genetic changes that weren't in either parent's DNA. They happen during egg development because the DNA repair machinery in the ovary is compromised.

As Dr. Hilary Martin from the Wellcome Sanger Institute put it: this is the first evidence that "existing common variation in DNA influences the rate of these changes" beyond just parental age.

So your mom's genetics didn't just influence when she hit menopause. They may have shaped what got written into your DNA in the first place.

## Why this matters

The ovary isn't just a reproductive organ with an expiration date. This research positions it as a window into how all of us age, a model for understanding DNA damage, cellular repair, and cancer risk across the whole body.

Your menopause timing isn't random. It's partly written in your genes, connected to your cancer risk, and linked to mutations you might pass to your kids. And until this study, nobody was connecting those dots.

You heard it here first. Pass it on.
