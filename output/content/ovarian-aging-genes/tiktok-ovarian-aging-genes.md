**[HOOK — 0-5s]**
Your ovaries age faster than every other organ in your body. And researchers just found one gene that shifts when you hit menopause by five and a half years.

**[KEY FACT — 5-17s]**
A Nature study on nearly 107,000 women found nine genes tied to menopause timing. Seven of them repair DNA damage. The same ones connected to cancer risk. One gene, SAMHD1, delays menopause but raises cancer risk in both women AND men.

**[WHY IT MATTERS — 17-25s]**
Your ovaries aren't just a reproductive organ. They're the fastest model of aging in your entire body. And your menopause timing? Partly genetic. Partly connected to what mutations get passed to your kids.
